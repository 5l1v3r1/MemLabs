# **MemLabs Lab 2 - A New World**

## **Challenge Description**

One of the clients of our company, lost the access to his system due to an unknown error. He is supposedly a very popular "environmental" activist. As a part of the investigation, he told us that his go to applications are browsers, his password managers etc. We hope that you can dig into this memory dump and find his important stuff and give it back to us.
